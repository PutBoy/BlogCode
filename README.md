All example code from my blog at: http://sebastiansprogramming.blogspot.se/

All code is posted for educational purposes, and is provided as-is. Feel free to use the code and experiment with it, if you come up with any improvements, feel free to let me know really. I don't intend for the code here to be excactly as is written in my posts forever.
